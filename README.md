## üå± How to start this project


**Important**: To do this activity, you need to `fork` [this repo](https://github.com/breatheco-de/exercise-starwars-data-modeling) into your **Github** account and then open the forked repo on [Codespaces](https://4geeks.com/lesson/what-is-github-codespaces) (recommended) or Gitpod.


In the `src/models.py` file of the forked repository, you will find several classes that represent the structure of a sample database.

Here is a 10 min video explaining what UML is: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UI6lqHOVHic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UI6lqHOVHic)

We are going to be creating the Entity Relationship Diagram for your StarWars Blog Database, a very similar diagram to this one:

[Click to open diagram](https://app.quickdatabasediagrams.com/#/d/LxNXQZ)

> üî• You can use this FREE tool to practice your diagram for the first time: https://app.quickdatabasediagrams.com/#/d/

## üíª Installation

1. Get inside the environment `$ pipenv shell`

2. Install all dependencies `$ pipenv install`

3. To generate a database diagram as many times as needed, run `$ pipenv run diagram`

4. Once the `diagram.png` file is created in the root of the project, open it to see the UML representation of your database.


## üìù Instructions

Your Job is to update the `src/models.py` file with the code needed to replicate the StarWars data model.

The project is using the SQLAlchemy Python library to generate the database.

- Your project must have a table `User` that will represent your blog users.
- Your blog users will be able to login and save their favorite planets and characters.
- The database should store the user favorites.
- The database should store characters and planets.
- What other tables do you think a blog like this might have?
- What properties should go inside the user? or inside the Character or Favorite table?
- What are the relationships between those tables?
- Please add at least 4 models with all of their properties.
- Generate the `diagram.png` file at the end by running `$ pipenv run diagram` on the console.
